# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm pursuing a joint PhD in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder.  My advisors are Dr. James Martin and Dr. Clayton Lewis.  I am interested in applying natural language processing to assistive communication devices and classroom applications.  Presently, I am a 4th year PhD student working as a Research Assistant with the National Science Foundation Institute for Student-AI Teaming.  As part of Strand 1 for the institute, I am designing a dialogue system to enhance collaboration between students in a small group setting.
