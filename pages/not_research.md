When I'm not busy conducting research at CU, I'm doing one of the following:

# Community Outreach
## Computer Science Graduate Students Association
In August 2020, I began graduate school and was asked to take up the position of "Tea Time Coordinator" for the Computer Science Graduate's Association.  During the pandemic, this inovlved sending ridiculous tea-themed emails and hosting weekly casual zoom sessions for faculty, staff, and students within the department of Computer Science.  During the spring semester 2021, I was elected Vice Chair of the CSGSA - a change that involved more responsibility within the department including organizing orientation sessions for the incoming students, a department-wide scavenger hunt, and advocating for the rights of the graduate students.  This advocate role has continued since I was elected Chair of the CSGSA starting in Spring 2022.  You can read more about the CSGSA at our website [here](https://bouldercsgrads.org/).
 
## Ignite Adapative Sports
Outside of CU Boulder, I am a PSIA Level I Certified Ski Instructor.  Starting in the winter 2021-2022 season, I began volunteering with Ignite Adaptive Sports as an Adaptive Ski Instructor.  I have been certified as a full instructor for skiiers with visual impairments.

# Walnut

It would be unfair to create a personal website, without a shoutout to my constant supporter, personal rubber duck, and one-time coworker (thanks to Amazon allowing dogs): the amazing Walnut also known as Walnut S. Bear, Wally, Wallbutt, or the Queen of Wallingford.  Walnut was born on August 9, 2015, and we have been together since October 9 that year.  She worked at Amazon for 4 1/2 years, then moved to Colorado in August 2020 to start her PHD in addressing whether it's really just wind or is it a ghost. Walnut has driven round-trip from Boulder, CO to Seattle WA and had the opportunity to visit Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana along the way.  At 12 pounds soaking wet, she is unofficially considered the smallest dog to have evaded stampede by bison during this road trip.
