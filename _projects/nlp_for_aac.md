description: This research aims to improve alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) devices for children with complex communication needs by integrating state of the art natural language processing models.  These models incorporate additional context into the devices such as dialogue acts to improve on-device phrase suggestions and reduce response time. My research is supported by a grant from the University of Colorado Boulder's Institute for Cognitive Science.
